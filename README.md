# PocketHLE

> High-level emulator for Windows Mobile / Pocket PC games.
> Inspired by [touchHLE](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE) (iPhone OS) and
> [EKA2L1](https://github.com/EKA2L1/EKA2L1) (Symbian).

PocketHLE focuses on running individual Pocket PC 2002 / 2003 / Windows Mobile
5/6 games without emulating an entire Windows CE kernel. Like touchHLE, it
loads a real game executable, runs the ARM code in a CPU emulator, and
implements the system DLLs (`coredll`, `aygshell`, `gx`, `hss`, ...) on the
host side so the game thinks it's running on a real Pocket PC.

The first target ROM is a small physics game called **JumpyBall** (provided
by the user, ARM PE32, Windows CE 5 GUI). All work is driven from the public
APIs that this game uses.

> **Status:** early but visibly working — the ARM CPU runs, the loader
> works, system-DLL imports are intercepted, a software-rasterised
> framebuffer is wired through GDI/GAPI, and JumpyBall reaches its
> main menu and credits screen out of the box (`pockethle run
> JumpyBallPPC.cab`). See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for what is still
> stubbed.

## Features

- **CAB extractor** — unpacks Windows Mobile `.CAB` archives. Auto-detects the
  largest ARM `.exe` inside.
- **PE32 loader** — supports the WinCE flavour of `IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM`
  (`0x01c0`), parses imports by ordinal *and* name, lays out sections in the
  emulated address space.
- **Pluggable CPU backend** — a tiny `Cpu` trait with two implementations:
  - `stub` — software-only, no real instruction decoding, used for tests.
  - `unicorn` — wraps [Unicorn Engine 2](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/);
    runs real ARM machine code at native-ish speed.
- **HLE thunk dispatcher** — every imported symbol is rewritten in the IAT
  to point at a synthetic 4-byte page. The CPU gets a code hook on each
  thunk; on hit, the host's [`WinCeDispatcher`] looks up a Rust handler and
  resumes execution at `LR`.
- **Ordinal → name resolver** — partial maps for `coredll.dll` and
  `aygshell.dll` shipped as JSON data files. The resolver kicks in
  automatically so logs say `PeekMessageW` instead of `ord 266`.
- **Linux CLI frontend** with `pe-info`, `unpack-cab`, `inspect-cab` and
  `run` subcommands.
- **Cross-platform desktop GUI** — `pocket-desktop` (egui) for Linux & Windows.
  Library / import / settings screens inspired by
  [j2me-loader](https://github.com/nikita36078/j2me-loader).
- **Android launcher** — Gradle project with a j2me-loader-style RecyclerView,
  per-game settings, FAB import, and a `SurfaceView`-based game screen.
- **Cross-platform CI** — GitHub Actions builds release artifacts for Linux
  (`tar.gz`), Windows (`zip`) and Android (`apk`) on every push, the way
  [touchHLE](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE) does.

+--------------------------------------------+
```

When `Emulator::run()` is invoked:

1. `pocket-cab` unpacks the user's `.CAB` and identifies the game `.exe`.
2. `pocket-pe` parses the PE, builds a list of `LoadedSection`s and the
   `Vec<ImportSymbol>` describing every imported function.
3. `pocket-kernel::Process::map_into` creates the address space:
   - maps each section,
   - allocates a `THUNK_REGION_BASE` pool of 4-byte stubs (`bx lr`),
   - patches the IAT so every imported symbol points at one of those
     stubs,
   - registers a code hook on every stub.
4. `pocket-kernel::run_main_loop` enters Unicorn at the entry point. As soon
   as the guest jumps through any IAT entry, Unicorn returns control;
   `WinCeDispatcher::dispatch` looks up the symbol and invokes the matching
   Rust handler, then resumes the guest at `LR`.

This is exactly the design touchHLE uses for Objective-C runtime calls and
Foundation, just adapted to Win32-style import tables.

## Building on Linux

```bash
# 1. Toolchain
rustup default stable               # 1.85+ recommended

# 2. Native deps (Ubuntu / Debian)
sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential pkg-config libclang-dev \
                    libgtk-3-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
                    libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxcb1-dev \
                    libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev \
                    libxcursor-dev libxdamage-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev

# 3. Build everything (stub CPU only — fast, ~30 s)
cargo build --release --workspace

# 4. Build the CLI with the real ARM CPU backend (~3 minutes first time;
#    Unicorn Engine is built from source).
cargo build --release -p pocket-cli      --features unicorn
cargo build --release -p pocket-desktop  --features unicorn

# 5. Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

The resulting binaries live at:

- `target/release/pockethle`     — CLI (`pe-info`, `unpack-cab`, `inspect-cab`, `run`, ...)
- `target/release/pockethle-gui` — desktop GUI (`pocket-desktop`)

## Building on Windows

PocketHLE builds out of the box on Windows with the MSVC toolchain (the same
way touchHLE distributes its Windows build).

```powershell
# 1. Install rustup, then:
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# 2. Build CLI + desktop GUI (stub CPU — fast)
cargo build --release -p pocket-cli
cargo build --release -p pocket-desktop

# 3. (Optional) Real ARM CPU via Unicorn Engine — needs cmake on PATH
#    and a working MSVC C/C++ toolchain. Building Unicorn from source the
#    first time takes a few minutes.
cargo build --release -p pocket-cli      --features unicorn
cargo build --release -p pocket-desktop  --features unicorn
```

The resulting binaries are `target\release\pockethle.exe` and
`target\release\pockethle-gui.exe`.

Double-clicking `pockethle-gui.exe` opens a small launcher window: import a
`.CAB`, pick a game from the library, hit Run.

## Trying it on the JumpyBall test ROM

The `run` subcommand accepts a Pocket PC `.exe`, a `.cab`, or a
`.zip` directly — archives are auto-extracted into a temp dir and the
largest ARM PE inside is launched. The default build of `pockethle`
includes both the `unicorn` CPU and the `display` host-window
features so a freshly-checked-out repo can render a game without
extra flags.

```bash
# (a) Run from the original Microsoft cabinet — auto-extracts and
#     auto-mounts the cabinet contents at the guest's `\Application\`
#     so CreateFileW finds the bundled resources.
pockethle run ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab

# (b) Same, but pop a host window with the live framebuffer.
pockethle run ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab --display

# (c) Headless capture: dump every rendered frame as PPM and stop
#     after eight frames — useful for CI / regression diffs.
pockethle run ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab \
    --dump-frames-to /tmp/jumpy_frames --max-frames 8

# (d) The classic flow is still supported if you want to inspect
#     things by hand:
pockethle inspect-cab ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab
pockethle unpack-cab  ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab /tmp/jumpy
pockethle pe-info     /tmp/jumpy/JUMPYB~1.002
pockethle run         /tmp/jumpy/JUMPYB~1.002

# (e) For trace-only analysis (no real CPU), pass `--cpu stub`. This
#     does not require the Unicorn build.
pockethle run ~/JumpyBallPPC.cab --cpu stub --max-slices 1
```

Real PPC2003 games typically need a few hundred thousand emulated
slices to finish their CRT init, build their soft-float lookup
tables and load bitmap resources before the first `WM_PAINT` is
delivered. `pockethle run` therefore defaults to `--max-slices
2_000_000`; pass a smaller value for fast smoke tests, or `0` for no
upper bound.

The first time you run an unfamiliar binary, expect to see lines
like:

```
[INFO  pocket_kernel] entering emulated main: entry=0x000247c8, stack_top=0x60000000
[WARN  pocket_winceapi] unimplemented call -> COREDLL.dll!CreateDirectoryW
...
```

Each `unimplemented call` line is a clue: that API needs a real handler in
`crates/pocket-winceapi/src/coredll.rs` (or wherever appropriate) before the
game can progress. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Building for Android

The Android frontend lives in [`frontends/pocket-android`](frontends/pocket-android).
It depends on:

- Android Studio Iguana (or any AGP 8.4+ install)
- Android NDK r26 or newer
- [`cargo-ndk`](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk) (`cargo install cargo-ndk`)

Build:

```bash
# 1. Cross-compile the JNI bridge for the two Android ABIs we ship.
cargo ndk \
    -t arm64-v8a \
    -t armeabi-v7a \
    -o frontends/pocket-android/app/src/main/jniLibs \
    build --release -p pocket-android-jni

# 2. Build the APK (uses the Gradle wrapper).
cd frontends/pocket-android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK lands in
`frontends/pocket-android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

The Android UI is modelled on
[j2me-loader](https://github.com/nikita36078/j2me-loader): a RecyclerView
launcher with per-game cards (Run / Settings / Remove), a FAB to import
new `.CAB` files via the system file picker, a global settings screen
(default CPU backend, log verbosity), and a per-game settings screen
(CPU backend, dispatch slice budget, halt-on-unimplemented). Running a
game opens a `SurfaceView`-backed `GameActivity` that displays the
emulator's framebuffer.

## Library layout

The desktop GUI and the Android launcher share an on-disk library managed
by the [`pocket-library`](crates/pocket-library) crate. It looks like
this:

```
<library-root>/
├── library.json          # index of imported games
├── config.json           # default CPU backend, log verbosity, ...
└── games/
    └── <sanitized-id>/
        ├── game.json     # display name, source CAB, per-game settings
        ├── source.cab    # original archive (kept for re-extraction)
        └── extracted/
            └── ... PE / data files ...
```

On Linux/Windows the default root is
`~/.local/share/PocketHLE/library` (or platform equivalent via
[`directories`](https://docs.rs/directories)).
On Android it lives under the app's external files dir,
`getExternalFilesDir(null)/library`.

## Roadmap

The order below roughly matches what JumpyBall calls into during its first
hundred milliseconds:

1. **CRT prologue** — `__chkstk`, `_setjmp`, `longjmp`, `_except_handler3`.
2. **Window setup** — `RegisterClassW`, `CreateWindowExW`, `ShowWindow`,
   `SHFullScreen`.
3. **Resource loading** — `FindResourceW`, `LoadResource`, `LockResource`,
   `CreateFileW`, `ReadFile`.
4. **GDI** — `BeginPaint`, `EndPaint`, `BitBlt`, `Rectangle`, `FillRect`,
   `CreateCompatibleDC/Bitmap`, `SelectObject`, `DeleteObject`. We will
   implement this as a software-rasterised framebuffer that gets blitted
   straight to the host's window.
5. **GAPI** — already stubbed in `pocket-winceapi/src/gx.rs`. Hook up the
   `GXBeginDraw` framebuffer to a host-side window (SDL2 on Linux,
   `SurfaceView` on Android).
6. **Audio** — replace the HSS stubs with real SDL2 / OpenSL ES playback.
7. **Input** — translate host keyboard / touch events to Pocket PC
   `WM_KEYDOWN` / `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` and pump them into the message queue.

Each milestone is intended to land as a separate small PR.

## Comparison to other emulators

| Project              | Target OS                       | Approach                  | Status                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `touchHLE`           | iPhone OS 2.x / 3.x             | High-level (HLE)          | Plays a handful of OpenGL ES games      |
| `EKA2L1`             | Symbian S60v3 / S60v5           | Mostly HLE, partial LLE   | Plays many Symbian games                |
| Microsoft Device Emu | Windows CE 5 / 6                | Full LLE (closed source)  | Discontinued                            |
| **PocketHLE** (this) | Windows Mobile 5 / 6 / Pocket PC| HLE                       | Loads + boots CRT for JumpyBall         |

PocketHLE deliberately copies touchHLE's layout — small Rust workspace,
HLE-first — because it scales well: every new game adds a few more API
implementations rather than years of low-level reverse engineering.
